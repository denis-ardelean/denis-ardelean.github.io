          <h5>Gaming</h5>
          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
            <p>The first hobby I want to present is gaming. I consider that gaming is part of a large portion of my life, and I consider it to be an important one that had an impact on my formation as a person.<br>When Denis, from childhood, came across video games he had the opportunity to try several types of games from which he chose FPS (First-Person Shooter) games to be his favourite, and I can say that he made a good choice, to this day it is my favorite style. Good job, kid Denis!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
            <p>From the many games I have played throughout my life, I choose to name the ones I liked the most. These games are in ascending order according to the age I was when I played them. The list is as follows: Battlefield 2 (7-8 years old), Call of Duty Modern Warfare (8 years old), APB: Reloaded (9-14 years old), Dying Light + DLCs (17 years old), Escape from Tarkov (19 years old).<br>With this list I finish talking about my passion for games and continue with the one for cooking.</p>

          <h5>Cooking</h5>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>I started to develop my passion for cooking when I was 11-12 years old. At that time, I was still choosing what I wanted to do in life, and I was telling everyone that I was going to become a chef and that I was going to go to MasterChef. Of course, with the passing of time I gave up the desire to become a chef and chose to keep cooking as a hobby.<br>The first "chef" for me was Jamie Oliver, at that time he was also quite famous. I remember spending hours in front of the TV watching the PaprikaTV channel, and rightfully so, I think I would do the same, but I can no longer afford that "luxury".</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>As I got older, I started watching videos and reading the most complex information about cooking, from cooking techniques to how certain ingredients work and influence a certain type of food. At the moment I'm watching content with and about cooking on YouTube, and I've found creators who are as close as possible to what I'm looking for (homecooking) and at the same time be fun. Some examples of creators would be: Adam Ragusea, Joshua Weissman, Brian Lagerstrom, Sip and Feast.</p>

          <h5>Motorcycle World</h5> <br>
            And the last hobby on this site, I chose to be the world of motorcycles.<br> I found a passion for motorcycles at the age of 22, although this world was also present in small proportions during my childhood, but only now I can it's really become a hobby. I started by watching videos on YouTube about anything related to motorcycles, most of them with tips for beginners. The more time I spent, the more I felt I wanted more information, I started to want to know how a motorcycle works down to the smallest part, I started reading books about motorcycles, how they work, how to maintain a motorcycle and how to fix it.<br> I managed to choose content creators who I can say were helpful in introducing me to this world and in satisfying my desire to learn as much as possible. "RevZilla" are the ones I personally consider the best when it comes to motorcycle content.
